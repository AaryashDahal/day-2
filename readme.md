Today I learned about position and gradient

POSITION
 It is used to set the position of content
 types of positions are as follows 
 1, absolute 
 2,relative
 3, sticky
 4, fixed
 all of these positions defult can be changed by using top, buttom,left and right property


GRADIENT

 It is a  property which combines colour.
 there are many types of gradient like linear-gradient,radical-gradient

 linear-gradient combines the colour in row or column where as radical gradient combines colour on a loop.
 The amount of certain colour can be changed by using different properties like
 degree,% etc
 we can use different keywords to change the way the colour combined-
 1,to top 
 2, to buttom
 3,to buttom left
 4, to top right
